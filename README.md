# Pong

This is my first attempt with [gint](https://gitea.planet-casio.com/Lephenixnoir/gint) creating an add-in for fx series casio calculators.

## Controls

Since this is a very simple game, controls are not included within the add-in. The controls are as following:

### player 1 
4 - move up
1 - move down 
5 - serve the ball
### player 2
รท - move up
- - move down 
x - serve the ball

No score system has been added, yet the game will be played indefinitely.

## Building

I would recommend using [fxsdk](https://gitea.planet-casio.com/Lephenixnoir/fxsdk) to build this with the following:

`fxsdk build-fx` 
to build for fx series calculators. This should create the pong.g1a file, which you can then copy to your calculator.
